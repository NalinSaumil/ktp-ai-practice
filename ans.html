      <td>There are many variables that impact your graduation timeline such as the number of classes you take each semester, enrollment in summer classes, having to repeat classes, missing prerequisites, etc. To determine a possible graduation timeline, consider the following: \n1. How many hours of degree requirements remain? \nUsing your degree plan, you can add up the hours of all classes that remain to figure out this number. 2. How many hours will you take each semester? Remember that 18 is the maximum for fall/spring, and 15 is the max for summer. \n3. Can I complete all necessary prerequisites by taking ___ hours each semester? Using your flowchart, you can make a tentative plan for classes that you will take each semester until graduation to make sure you do not miss any prerequisites. \n4. Did I miss anything? Share your plans with your academic advisor to verify that you have made a reasonable plan to meet your graduation goal.</td>
